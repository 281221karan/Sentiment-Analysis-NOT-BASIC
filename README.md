# Sentiment-Analysis-NOT-BASIC
Sentiment Analysis is most important thing for a company to observe the emotions of the customer. So i have created a sentiment analysis model from scratch.

from 0 to sentiment analysis

what i have built from scratch:
  1. BPE TOKENIZER
    - essential for tokenzing the input and to handle OOV tokens ( here for details - https://github.com/281221karan/BPE-BYTE-PAIR-ENCODING )
  
  2. Transformers models
    - i want to learn about how the attention mechanism works so i made a transformers model from scrach

thats all from scratch
